        <h1>Loranika Sharma Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>
        <h2>First, the basics.</h2>
        <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should list your top 3 goals for the class below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide by Ed Sheeran</li>
            <li>No.6 Collabarations by E Sheeran</li>
            <li>Lover by Taylor Swift</li>
            <li>1989 by Taylor Swify</li>
            <li>21 by Adele</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>
        <p> Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>

        <h3>Empty Elements</h3>
        <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. <br/>Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>
        <p>Add a hard line under here, and break the two previous lines using a soft break.</p>
        <hr/>
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>
        <img src = 'images/mochi.gif', alt = 'dancing mochi'/>
        <img src = 'images/mochi.jpg', alt = 'mochi in bubble'/>
        <img src = 'images/mochi.png', alt = 'mochi smiling'/>
        <img src = 'images/mochi.svg', alt = 'mini mochi'/><br/>
        <a href = 'https://github.com/loranikasharma/INST377-Lab-Work'>Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.</a><br/>
        <p>If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."</p>

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Sometimes you want to do both.

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

Images 
Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
